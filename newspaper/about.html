                <h5>Freelance Writing</h5>
                <p>
                  With millions of blogs and websites publishing new content
                  every day, there is a great demand for content, and for
                  quality writers.

                <h5>Content Marketing</h5>
                <p>
                  Content marketing is similar to freelance writing, but it
                  usually goes a few steps further. Most freelance writers will
                  write the article, and then their work is done.

                </div>
                <h5>Copywriting</h5>
                <p>
                  The skills needed to be a successful copywriter are more
                  specialized as compared to working as a freelance writer, but
                  you can also earn more money.

                </div>
                <h5>Blog Editing</h5>
                <p>
                  To work as an editor, you’ll need good skills related to
                  spelling and grammar, as well as an attention to detail.
                </p>
              </div>

                  <span class="material-symbols-outlined"> computer </span>
                </div>
                <h5>Web Design</h5>
                <p>
                  As a freelancer, you can charge a lower rate than an agency
                  because you have very little overhead, and you can still earn
                  a very nice income from it.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">

                <div class="img-wrapper">
                  <span class="material-symbols-outlined"> devices </span>
                </div>
                <h5>Web Development</h5>
                <p>
                  While web designers are responsible for the look and feel of a
                  website, web developers focus more on the coding. You’ll
                  definitely need coding skills, although that can be learned.
